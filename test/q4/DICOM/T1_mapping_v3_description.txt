This file provides information about the data set in the directory T1_mapping_v3

Two sets of images are provided.  DICOM part 10 format images are in the DICOM directory.  XML files are in the XML directory.  
The XML images allow the values for the DICOM tags to be altered using a text editor, and new DICOM images can then be generated using dcm4che's tool called "xml2dcm," availabie at http://www.dcm4che.org/confluence/display/d2/dcm4che2+DICOM+Toolkit.

The parameters used to generate this data are:

Repetition Time = 5 msecs
Assumed T1 (in tissue) = 1000 msecs
Assumed equilibrium magnetization (in tissue) = 1000
Assumed T1 (in blood vessel) = 1440 msecs
Assumed equilibrium magnetization (in blood vessel) = 1000


The signal intensity images were generated for the following different flip angles: 3, 6, 9, 15, 24, 35 degrees. The files in the zip folder have the 
following flip angles:

filename	flip angle (in degrees)
fa3		3 
fa6		6 
fa9		9
fa15		15
fa24		24
fa35		35


The signal intensity for the T1 mapping images was calculated using Equation 1 in the paper Comparison of three physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models for the prediction of contrast agent distribution measured by dynamic MR imaging, 
Barboriak DP, MacFall JR, Viglianti BL, Dewhirst MW. J Magn Reson Imaging. 2008 Jun;27(6):1388-98.

The data in the test image is organized as follows: The top 60*180 pixels in the image represent the tissue. The vascular region of interest is the 
bottom 60*20 pixels strip of the image.
